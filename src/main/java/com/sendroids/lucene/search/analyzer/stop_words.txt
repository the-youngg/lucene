#
# This file defines a stopword set with google stop words.
#
# This set is made up of hand-picked frequent terms from segmented Japanese Wikipedia.
# Punctuation characters and frequent kanji have mostly been left out.  See LUCENE-3745
# for frequency lists, etc. that can be useful for making your own set (if desired)
#
# Note that there is an overlap between these stopwords and the terms stopped when used
# in combination with the JapanesePartOfSpeechStopFilter.  When editing this file, note
# that comments are not allowed on the same line as stopwords.
#
# Also note that stopping is done in a case-insensitive manner.  Change your StopFilter
# configuration if you need case-sensitive stopping.  Lastly, note that stopping is done
# using the same character width as the entries in this file.  Since this StopFilter is
# normally done after a CJKWidthFilter in your chain, you would usually want your romaji
# entries to be in half-width and your kana entries to be in full-width.
